/**
 * **792. Number of Matching Subsequences**
 *
 * Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return *the number of `words[i]` that is a
 * subsequence of `s`*.
 *
 * A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some
 * characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * - For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} words
