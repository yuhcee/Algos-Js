/**
 * **30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words**
 *
 * You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of words are of **the same
 * length**.
 *
 * A **concatenated substring** in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of
 * `words` concatenated.
 *
 * - For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then `"abcdef"`, `"abefcd"`, `"cdabef"`, `"cdefab"`,
 * `"efabcd"`, and `"efcdab"` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef"` is not a concatenated substring
 * because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.
 *
 * Return *the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in
 * **any order**.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number[]}
