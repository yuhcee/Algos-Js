/**
 * **729. My Calendar I**
 *
 * You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will
 * not cause a **double booking**.
 *
 * **A double booking** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is
 * common to both events.).
 *
 * The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the half-open interval [`start, end`], the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.
 *
 * Implement the `MyCalendar` class:
 *
 * - `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.
 * - `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully
 * without causing a **double booking**. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 *
 * @param {number} start
 * @param {number} end
 * @return {boolean}
