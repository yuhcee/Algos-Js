/**
 * **1878. Get Biggest Three Rhombus Sums in a Grid**
 * 
 * You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid​​​`.
 * 
 * A *rhombus sum* is the sum of the elements that form the *border* of a regular rhombus shape in
 * `grid​​​`. The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners
 * centered in a grid cell. Below is an image of four valid rhombus shapes with the corresponding colored
 * cells that should be included in each *rhombus sum*:
 * 
 * Note that the rhombus can have an area of 0, which is depicted by the purple rhombus in the bottom
 * right corner.
 * 
 * Return the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in the grid in descending order. If there are less than
 * three distinct values, return all of them.
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number[]}
