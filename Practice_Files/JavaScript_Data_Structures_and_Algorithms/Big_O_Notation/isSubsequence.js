/**
 * **IsSubSequence**
 *
 * Write a function which takes two strings and checks whether the characters of the first string form a
 * subsequence of the characters in the second string.
 *
 * In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in
 * the second string, **without their order changing**.
 *
 * Return *true if characters of the first string exist in their right ordering in the second string*.
