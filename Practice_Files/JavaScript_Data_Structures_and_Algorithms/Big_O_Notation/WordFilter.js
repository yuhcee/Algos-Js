/**
 * **745. Prefix and Suffix Search**
 * Design a special dictionary with some words that searchs the words in it by a prefix and a
 * suffix.
 *
 * Implement the WordFilter class:
 *
 * - `WordFilter(string[] words)` Initializes the object with the `words` in the dictionary.
 * - `f(string prefix, string suffix)` Returns *the index of the word in the dictionary*, which
 * has the prefix `prefix` and the suffix `suffix`. If there is more than one valid index,
 * return **the largest** of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return `-1`.
 *
 * @param {string[]} words
