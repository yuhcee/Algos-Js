/**
 * **Container With Most Water**
 *
 * You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the
 * two endpoints of the ith line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.
 *
 * Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the
 * most water.
 *
 * Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.
 *
 * **Notice** that you may not slant the container.
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
