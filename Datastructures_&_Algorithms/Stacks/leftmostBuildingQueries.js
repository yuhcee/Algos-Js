/**
 * **2940. Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet**
 *
 * You are given a **0-indexed** array `heights` of positive integers, where
 * `heights[i]` represents the height of the `ith` building.
 *
 * If a person is in building `i`, they can move to any other building `j` if
 * and only if `i < j` and `heights[i] < heights[j]`.
 *
 * You are also given another array `queries` where `queries[i] = [ai, bi]`. On
 * the `ith` query, Alice is in building `ai` while Bob is in building `bi`.
 *
 * Return *an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is **the index of the leftmost
 * building** where Alice and Bob can meet on the `ith` query.* If Alice and Bob
 * cannot move to a common building on query `i`, set `ans[i]` to `-1`.
 *
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {number[]}
