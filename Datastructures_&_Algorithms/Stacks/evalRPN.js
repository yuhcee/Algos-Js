/**
 * **150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**
 * 
 * You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an 
 * arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
 * 
 * Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value 
 * of the expression*.
 * 
 * **Note** that:
 * 
 * - The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
 * - Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
 * - The division between two integers always **truncates toward zero**.
 * - There will not be any division by zero.
 * - The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse 
 * polish notation.
 * - The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented 
 * in a **32-bit** integer.
 * 
 * @param {string[]} tokens
 * @return {number}
