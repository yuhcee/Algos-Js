/**
 * **1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings**
 *
 * You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two
 * types of operations any number of times.
 *
 * - Remove substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points.
 *  - For example, when removing `"ab"` from `"cabxbae"` it becomes `"cxbae"`.
 * - Remove substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points.
 *  - For example, when removing `"ba"` from `"cabxbae"` it becomes `"cabxe"`.
 *
 * Return *the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on
 * `s`*.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
 * - `1 <= x, y <= 104`
 * - `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} x
 * @param {number} y
 * @return {number}
