 * the tree with the **sum of all its cousins' values**.
 *
 * Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth
 * with different parents.
 *
 * Return *the `root` of the modified tree*.
 *
 * **Note** that the depth of a node is the number of edges in the path
 * from the root node to it.

 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 105]`.
 * - `1 <= Node.val <= 104`
 *
