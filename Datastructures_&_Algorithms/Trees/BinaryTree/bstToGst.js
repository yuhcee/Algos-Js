 * Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree
 * such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus
 * the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
 *
 * As a reminder, a *binary search tree* is a tree that satisfies these
 * constraints:
 *
 * - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the
 * node's key.
 * - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than**
 * the node's key.
 * - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
