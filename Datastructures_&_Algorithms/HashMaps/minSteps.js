/**
 * **1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram**
 *
 * You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose **any
 * character** of `t` and replace it with **another character**.
 *
 * Return *the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`*.
 *
 * An **Anagram** of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or
 * the same) ordering.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
 * - `s.length == t.length`
 * `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {number}
