/**
 * **2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty**
 *
 * You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` consisting of positive
 * integers.
 *
 * There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array
 * **any** number of times:
 *
 * - Choose **two** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them
 * from the array.
 * - Choose **three** elements with **equal** values and **delete** them
 * from the array.
 *
 * Return *the **minimum** number of operations required to make the
 * array empty, or `-1` if it is not possible.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 * - `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
 * - `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
