/**
 * **791. Custom Sort String**
 *
 * You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of order
 * are **unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.
 *
 * Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order`
 * was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a
 * character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the
 * permuted string.
 *
 * Return *any permutation of s that satisfies this property.*
 *
 * @param {string} order
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
