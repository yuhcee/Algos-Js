/**
 * **621. Task Scheduler**
 *
 * You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time,
 * `n`. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any
 * order, but there's a constraint: **identical** tasks must be separated by at least `n` intervals
 * due to cooling time.
 *
 * â€‹Return the *minimum number of intervals* required to complete all tasks.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= tasks.length <= 104`
 * - `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.
 * - `0 <= n <= 100`
 *
 * @param {character[]} tasks
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed. */
