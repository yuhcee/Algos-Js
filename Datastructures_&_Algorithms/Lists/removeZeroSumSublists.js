 * **1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List**
 *
 * Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive
 * sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.
 *
 * After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return
 * any such answer.
 *
 * (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of
 * `ListNode` objects.)
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - The given linked list will contain between `1` and `1000` nodes.
 * - Each node in the linked list has -`1000 <= node.val <= 1000`.
 *
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
