/**
 * **2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List**
 *
 * In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is even, the `ith` node
 * (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the `(n-1-i)th`
 * node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.
 *
 * - For example, if `n = 4`, then node `0` is the twin of node `3`, and
 * node `1` is the twin of node `2`. These are the only nodes with twins
 * for `n = 4`.
 * The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.
 *
 * Given the `head` of a linked list with even length, return the
 * ***maximum twin sum** of the linked list*.
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 * - The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
 * - `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
 *
 * Returns the maximum twin sum of the linked list.
 * @param {ListNode} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @returns {number} - The maximum twin sum.
