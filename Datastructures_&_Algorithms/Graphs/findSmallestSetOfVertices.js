/**
 * **1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes**
 * 
 * Given a **directed acyclic graph**, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to 
 * `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` represents a 
 * directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.
 * 
 * *Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are 
 * reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.*
 * 
 * Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
 * 
 * @param {number} n - The number of vertices in the graph.
 * @param {number[][]} edges - The array of directed edges.
 * @return {number[]} - The smallest set of vertices from which all nodes 
 * are reachable.
