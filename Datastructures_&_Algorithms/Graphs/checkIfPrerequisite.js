/**
 * **1462. Course Schedule IV**
 *
 * There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from
 * `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where
 * `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course
 * `ai` first if you want to take course `bi`.
 *
 * - For example, the pair `[0, 1]` indicates that you have to take course
 * `0` before you can take course `1`.
 * Prerequisites can also be **indirect**. If course `a` is a prerequisite
 * of course `b`, and course `b` is a prerequisite of course `c`, then
 * course `a` is a prerequisite of course `c`.
 *
 * You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [uj, vj]`. For
 * the `jth` query, you should answer whether course `uj` is a prerequisite
 * of course `vj` or not.
 *
 * Return *a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the answer to the
 * `jth` query*.
 *
 * @param {number} numCourses
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {boolean[]}
