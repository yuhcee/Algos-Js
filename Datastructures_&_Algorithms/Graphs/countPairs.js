/**
 * **2316. Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph**
 *
 * You are given an integer `n`. There is an **undirected** graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to
 * `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there
 * exists an **undirected** edge connecting nodes `ai` and `bi`.
 *
 * Return *the **number of pairs** of different nodes that are **unreachable** from each other.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= n <= 105`
 * - `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105`
 * - `edges[i].length == 2`
 * - `0 <= ai, bi < n`
 * - `ai != bi`
 * - There are no repeated edges.
 * 
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}
