/**
 * **2685. Count the Number of Complete Components**
 *
 * You are given an integer `n`. There is an **undirected** graph with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You
 * are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge
 * connecting vertices `ai` and `bi`.
 *
 * Return the number of **complete connected components** of the graph.
 *
 * A **connected component** is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no
 * vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.
 *
 * A connected component is said to be **complete** if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}
