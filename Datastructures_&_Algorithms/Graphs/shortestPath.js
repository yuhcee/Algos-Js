/**
 * **1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination**
 * 
 * You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You can 
 * move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in **one step**.
 * 
 * Return *the minimum number of **steps** to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m 
 * - 1, n - 1)` given that you can eliminate **at most** `k` obstacles*. If it is not possible to find such walk 
 * return `-1`.
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
