/**
 * **3243. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I**
 *
 * You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `queries`.
 *
 * There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Initially, there is a
 * **unidirectional** road from city `i` to city `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n -
 * 1`.
 *
 * `queries[i] = [ui, vi]` represents the addition of a new **unidirectional**
 * road from city `ui` to city `vi`. After each query, you need to find the
 * **length** of the **shortest path** from city `0` to `city n - 1`.
 *
 * Return an array `answer` where for each `i` in the range `[0, queries.length
 * - 1]`, `answer[i]` is the *length of the shortest path* from city `0` to
 * city `n - 1` after processing the **first** `i + 1` queries.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {number[]}
