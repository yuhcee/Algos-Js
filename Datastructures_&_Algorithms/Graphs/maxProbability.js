/**
 * **1514. Path with Maximum Probability**
 * 
 * You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list 
 * where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability 
 * of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.
 * 
 * Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from 
 * `start` to `end` and return its success probability.
 * 
 * If there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be accepted if it differs 
 * from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.
 * 
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @param {number[]} succProb
 * @param {number} start
 * @param {number} end
 * @return {number}
