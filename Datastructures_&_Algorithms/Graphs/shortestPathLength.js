/**
 * **847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes**
 *
 * You have an undirected, connected graph of `n` nodes labeled
 * from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an array `graph` where
 * `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i`
 * by an edge.
 *
 * Return *the length of the shortest path that visits every
 * node*. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit
 * nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `n == graph.length`
 * - `1 <= n <= 12`
 * - `0 <= graph[i].length < n`
 * - `graph[i]` does not contain `i`.
 * - If `graph[a]` contains `b`, then `graph[b]` contains `a`.
 * - The input graph is always connected.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {number}
