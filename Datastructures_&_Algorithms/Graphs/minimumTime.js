/**
 * **2050. Parallel Courses III**
 *
 * You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`.
 * You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where `relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej]
 * ` denotes that course `prevCoursej` has to be completed **before** course `nextCoursej`
 * (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a **0-indexed** integer array `time`
 * where `time[i]` denotes how many **months** it takes to complete the `(i+1)th` course.
 *
 * You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these
 * rules:
 *
 * - You may start taking a course at **any time** if the prerequisites are met.
 * - **Any number of courses** can be taken at the **same time**.
 *
 * Return *the **minimum** number of months needed to complete all the courses.
 *
 * **Note:** The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e.,
 * the graph is a directed acyclic graph).
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} relations
 * @param {number[]} time
 * @return {number}
