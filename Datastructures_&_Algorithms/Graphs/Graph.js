/**
 * **2642. Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator**
 *
 * There is a **directed weighted** graph that consists of `n` nodes
 * numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges of the graph are initially
 * represented by the given array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi,
 * toi, edgeCosti]` meaning that there is an edge from `fromi` to
 * `toi` with the cost `edgeCosti`.
 *
 * Implement the `Graph` class:
 *
 * - `Graph(int n, int[][] edges)` initializes the object with `n`
 * nodes and the given edges.
 *
 * - `addEdge(int[] edge)` adds an edge to the list of edges where
 * `edge = [from, to, edgeCost]`. It is guaranteed that there is no
 * edge between the two nodes before adding this one.
 *
 * - `int shortestPath(int node1, int node2)` returns the **minimum**
 * cost of a path from `node1` to `node2`. If no path exists, return
 * `-1`. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in
 * the path.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
