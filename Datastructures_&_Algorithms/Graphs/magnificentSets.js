/**
 * **2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups**
 *
 * You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in
 * an **undirected** graph. The nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`.
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]
 * ` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** edge between nodes `ai`
 * and `bi`. **Notice** that the given graph may be disconnected.
 *
 * Divide the nodes of the graph into `m` groups (**1-indexed**) such that:
 *
 * - Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
 * - For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge `
 * [ai, bi]`, if `ai` belongs to the group with index `x`, and `bi` belongs
 * to the group with index `y`, then `|y - x| = 1`.
 *
 * Return *the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum `m`) into which you
 * can divide the nodes. Return `-1` if it is impossible to group the nodes
 * with the given conditions.*
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}
