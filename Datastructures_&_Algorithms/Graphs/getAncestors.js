/**
 * **2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph**
 *
 * You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a
 * **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to ```
 * (**inclusive**).
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [fromi,
 * toi]` denotes that there is a **unidirectional** edge from `fromi` to
 * `toi` in the graph.
 *
 * Return a list `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the **list of ancestors**
 * of the `ith` node, sorted in **ascending order**.
 *
 * A node `u` is an **ancestor** of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v`
 * via a set of edges.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number[][]}
