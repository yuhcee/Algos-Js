/**
 * **2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid**
 *
 * You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell
 * in all `4` directions.
 *
 * Return *the number of **strictly increasing** paths in the grid such that you can start from
 * **any** cell and end at **any** cell*. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo**
 * `109 + 7`.
 *
 * Two paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `m == grid.length`
 * - `n == grid[i].length`
 * - `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
 * - `1 <= m * n <= 105`
 * - `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`
 *
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
