/**
 * **714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee**
 *
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day,
 * and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like,
 * but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the
 * stock before you buy again).
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104`
 * - `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104`
 * - `0 <= fee < 5 * 104`
 *
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @param {number} fee
 * @return {number}
