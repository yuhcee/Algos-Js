/**
 * **688. Knight Probability in Chessboard**
 *
 * On an `n x n` chessboard, a knight starts at the cell `(row, column)` and attempts to make exactly
 * `k` moves. The rows and columns are **0-indexed**, so the top-left cell is `(0, 0)`, and the
 * bottom-right cell is `(n - 1, n - 1)`.
 *
 * A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells
 * in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} k
 * @param {number} row
 * @param {number} column
 * @return {number}
