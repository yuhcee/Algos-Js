/**
 * **1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick**
 *
 * Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For
 * example, a stick of length **6** is labelled as follows:
 *
 * Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.
 *
 * You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.
 *
 * The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs
 * of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of
 * their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example
 * for a better explanation.
 *
 * Return *the minimum total cost* of the cuts.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `2 <= n <= 106`
 * - `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
 * - `1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
 * - All the integers in `cuts` array are **distinct**.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[]} cuts
 * @return {number}
