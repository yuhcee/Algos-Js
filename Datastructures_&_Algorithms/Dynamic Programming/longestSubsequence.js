/**
 * **1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference**
 * 
 * Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest 
 * subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent 
 * elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.
 * 
 * A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements 
 * without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} difference
 * @return {number}
