/**
 * **Regex Matcher**
 *
 * Given a string `text` and a `pattern`. Evaluate if the given string
 * matches matches the full text of the pattern. Check if a given pattern
 * exists in a given string or not including wild cards * and .
 *
 * In this problem, we are given a string (text) and a pattern, which can
 * contain wildcard characters '*' and '.', and we need to check if the
 * pattern matches the text or not.
 *
 * Matching criteria:
 * - `"."` represents any single character.
 * - `"*"` represents zero or more repeating times of the character just
 * before it.
 *
 * **Constraints**
 *
 * - `1 <= text.length <= 20`
 * - `1 <= pattern.length <= 20`
 * - `text` and `pattern` are lowercase English letters.
