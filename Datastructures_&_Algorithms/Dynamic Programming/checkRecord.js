/**
 * **552. Student Attendance Record II**
 *
 * - `'A'`: Absent.
 * - `'L'`: Late.
 * - `'P'`: Present.
 *
 * Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the
 * following criteria:
 *
 * - The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
 * - The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.
 *
 * Given an integer `n`, return the **number** of possible attendance records of
 * length `n` that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer
 * may be very large, so return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
