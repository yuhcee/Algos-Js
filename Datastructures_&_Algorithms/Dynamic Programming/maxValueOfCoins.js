/**
 * **2218. Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles**
 *
 * There are `n` **piles* of coins on a table. Each pile consists of a **positive number** of
 * coins of assorted denominations.
 *
 * In one move, you can choose any coin on **top** of any pile, remove it, and add it to your
 * wallet.
 *
 * Given a list `piles`, where `piles[i]` is a list of integers denoting the composition of the
 * `ith` pile from **top to bottom**, and a positive integer `k`, return *the **maximum total
 * value** of coins you can have in your wallet if you choose **exactly** `k` coins optimally.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `n == piles.length`
 * - `1 <= n <= 1000`
 * - `1 <= piles[i][j] <= 105`
 * - `1 <= k <= sum(piles[i].length) <= 2000`
 *
 * @param {number[][]} piles
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
