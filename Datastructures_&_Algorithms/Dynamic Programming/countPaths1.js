/**
 * **1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination**
 *
 * You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with **bi-directional** roads
 * between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other
 * intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.
 *
 * You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a
 * road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes timei minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can
 * travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the **shortest amount of time**.
 *
 * Return *the **number of ways** you can arrive at your destination in the **shortest amount of time**.* Since the
 * answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} roads
 * @return {number}
