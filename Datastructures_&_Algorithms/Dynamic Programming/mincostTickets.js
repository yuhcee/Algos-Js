/**
 * **983. Minimum Cost For Tickets**
 * 
 * You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in 
 * which you will travel are given as an integer array `days`. Each day is an integer 
 * from `1` to `365`.
 * 
 * Train tickets are sold in **three different ways**:
 * 
 * - a **1-day** pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
 * - a **7-day** pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars, and
 * - a **30-day** pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.
 * 
 * The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.
 * 
 * - For example, if we get a **7-day** pass on day `2`, then we can travel for `7` 
 * days: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, and `8`.
 * 
 * Return *the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given 
 * list of days*.
 * 
 * 
 * @param {number[]} days
 * @param {number[]} costs
 * @return {number}
