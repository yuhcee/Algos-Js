/**
 * **1092. Shortest Common Supersequenc**
 *
 * Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return *the shortest string that
 * has both `str1` and `str2` as **subsequences***. If there are multiple
 * valid strings, return **any** of them.
 *
 * A string `s` is a **subsequence** of string `t` if deleting some number
 * of characters from `t` (possibly `0`) results in the string `s`.
 *
 * @param {string} str1
