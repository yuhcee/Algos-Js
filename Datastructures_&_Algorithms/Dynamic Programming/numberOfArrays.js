/**
 * **1416. Restore The Array**
 *
 * A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and
 * the array is printed as a string of digits `s` and all we know is that all integers in the array
 * were in the range `[1, k]` and there are no leading zeros in the array.
 *
 * Given the string `s` and the integer `k`, return *the number of the possible arrays that can be
 * printed as `s` using the mentioned program*. Since the answer may be very large, return it
 * **modulo** `109 + 7`.
 *
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
