/**
 * **516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence**
 *
 * Given a string `s`, find *the longest palindromic **subsequence's** length in
 * `s`*.
 *
 * A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by
 * deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining
 * elements.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
 * - `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
