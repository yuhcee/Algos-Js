/**
 * **1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One**
 *
 * Given the binary representation of an integer as a string `s`, return *the
 * number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:*
 *
 * - If the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`.
 *
 * - If the current number is odd, you have to add `1` to it.
 *
 * - It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.
 *
