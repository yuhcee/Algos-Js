/**
 * **RunLength**
 * 
 * Have the function `RunLength(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return a 
 * compressed version of the string using the `Run-length encoding algorithm`. This algorithm 
 * works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character and outputting that number along 
 * with a single character of the repeating sequence. 
 * 
 * For example: `"wwwggopp"` would return `3w2g1o2p`. The string will not contain any numbers, 
 * punctuation, or symbols.
 * 
 * Once your function is working, take the final output string and intersperse it 
 * character-by-character with your ChallengeToken.
 * 
 * Your ChallengeToken: enpohq47kd68
 * 
 * 
 * @param {string} str
 * @returns {string}
