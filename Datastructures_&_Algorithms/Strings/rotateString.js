/**
 * **796. Rotate String**
 *
 * Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return *`true` if and only if `s` can
 * become `goal` after some number of **shifts** on `s`*.
 *
 * A **shift** on s consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to
 * the rightmost position.
 *
 * For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then it will be `"bcdea"` after one
 * shift.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} goal
 * @return {boolean}
