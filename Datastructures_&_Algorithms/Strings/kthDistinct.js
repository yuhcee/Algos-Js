 *
 * A **distinct string** is a string that is present only **once** in an
 * array.

 * Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return *the `kth`
 * **distinct string** present in `arr`*. If there are **fewer** than `k`
 * distinct strings, return *an **empty string** `""`*.
 *
 * Note that the strings are considered in the **order in which they
 * appear** in the array.
