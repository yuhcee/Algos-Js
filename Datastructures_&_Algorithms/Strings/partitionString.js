/**
 * **2405. Optimal Partition of String**
 *
 * Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in
 * each substring are **unique**. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than
 * **once**.
 *
 * Return *the **minimum** number of substrings in such a partition*.
 *
 * Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
 * - `s` consists of only English lowercase letters.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
