/**
 * **1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close**
 *
 * Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the
 * other using the following operations:
 *
 * - Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.
 *   - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`
 *
 * - Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing**
 * character into another existing character, and do the same with the
 * other character.
 *   - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and
 * all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)
 *
 * You can use the operations on either string as many times as
 * necessary.
 *
 * Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return *`true` if `word1` and
 * `word2` are **close**, and `false` otherwise*.
 *
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {boolean}
