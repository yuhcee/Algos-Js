/**
 * **2914. Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful**
 *
 * You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` having an even
 * length.
 *
 * A string is **beautifu**l if it's possible to partition it into one
 * or more substrings such that:
 *
 * - Each substring has an **even** length.
 * - Each substring contains **only** `1`'s or **only** `0`'s.
 *
 * You can change any character in `s` to `0` or `1`.
 *
 * Return the **minimum** number of changes required to make the
 * string `s` beautiful.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 * - `2 <= s.length <= 105`
 * - `s` has an even length.
 * - `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
 * 
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
