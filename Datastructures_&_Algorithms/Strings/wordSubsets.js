/**
 * **916. Word Subsets**
 * 
 * You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.
 * 
 * A string `b` is a **subset** of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs 
 * in `a` including multiplicity.
 * 
 * - For example, `"wrr"` is a subset of `"warrior"` but is not a subset of 
 * `"world"`.
 * 
 * A string `a` from `words1` is **universal** if for every string `b` in 
 * `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.
 * 
 * Return an array of all the **universal** strings in `words1`. You may 
 * return the answer in **any order**.
 * 
 * @param {string[]} words1
 * @param {string[]} words2
 * @return {string[]}
