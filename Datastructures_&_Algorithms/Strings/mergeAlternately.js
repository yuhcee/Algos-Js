/**
 * **1768. Merge Strings Alternately**
 *
 * You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating

 * Return *the merged string*.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
 * - `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
