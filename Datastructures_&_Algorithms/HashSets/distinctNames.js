/**
 * **2306. Naming a Company**
 *
 *
 * You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process
 * of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:
 *
 * 1. Choose 2 **distinct** names from `ideas`, call them `ideaA` and `ideaB`.
 *
 * 2. Swap the first letters of `ideaA` and `ideaB` with each other.
 *
 * 3. If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name `ideaA` `ideaB`
 * (the **concatenation** of `ideaA` and `ideaB`, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
 *
 * 4. Otherwise, it is not a valid name.
 *
 * Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
 * @param {string[]} ideas
 * @return {number}
