/**
 * **Get Latest K Requests**
 *
 *
 * Given `n` request ids as an array of strings, `requests`, and an
 * integer `k`, after all requests are received, find the `k` most recent
 * requests.
 *
 * Report the answer in order of most recent to least recent.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Suppose n = 5, requests - ['item 1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item 1',
 * 'Item3'] and k = 3.
 *
 * Starting from the right and moving left, collecting distinct requests,
 * there is `"item3"` followed by `"item1"`. Skip the second instance of
 * "item3" and find "item2". The answer is ['item3*, "item1*, item27.
 *

 *
 * `getLatestKRequests` takes the following arguments:
 * - str `requests(n)`: the request ids
