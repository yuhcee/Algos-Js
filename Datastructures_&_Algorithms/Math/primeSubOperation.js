/**
 * **2601. Prime Subtraction Operation**
 *
 * You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.
 *
 * You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
 *
 * - Pick an index `i` that you haven’t picked before, and pick a prime `p` **strictly less than** `nums[i]
 * `, then subtract `p` from `nums[i]`.
 *
 * Return *`true` if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false
 * otherwise*.
 *
 * A **strictly increasing array** is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding
 * element.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
