/**
 * **3152. Special Array II**
 *
 * An array is considered **special** if every pair of its adjacent elements
 * contains two numbers with different parity.
 *
 * You are given an array of integer `nums` and a 2D integer matrix `queries`,
 * where for `queries[i] = [fromi, toi]` your task is to check that
 * subarray `nums[fromi..toi]` is **special** or not.
 *
 * Return an array of booleans `answer` such that `answer[i]` is `true` if `nums
 * [fromi..toi]` is special.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {boolean[]}
