/**
 * **1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal**
 *
 * You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string
 * swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not
 * necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.
 *
 * Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing
 * **at most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings.
 * Otherwise, return `false`.
 *
 * @param {string} s1
 * @param {string} s2
 * @return {boolean}
