/**
 * **57. Insert Interval**
 * You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where
 * `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the
 * `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`.
 * You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that
 * represents the start and end of another interval.
 *
 * Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still
 * sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have
 * any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
 *
 * Return *`intervals` after the insertion.*
 *
 * **Note** that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make
 * a new array and return it.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @param {number[]} newInterval
 * @return {number[][]}
