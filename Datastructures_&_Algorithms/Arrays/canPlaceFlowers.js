/**
 * **605. Can Place Flowers**
 *
 * You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However,
 * flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.
 *
 * Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means
 * not empty, and an integer `n`, return *`true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed`
 * without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise*.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
 * - `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
 * - There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
 * - `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
 *
 * @param {number[]} flowerbed
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
