/**
 * **2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers**
 *
 * You have `n` computers. You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** integer array
 * `batteries` where the ith battery can run a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are
 * interested in running **all** `n` computers **simultaneously** using the given batteries.
 *
 * Initially, you can insert **at most one battery** into each computer. After that and at any
 * integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery **any
 * number of times**. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another
 * computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.
 *
 * Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.
 *
 * Return *the **maximum** number of minutes you can run all the `n` computers simultaneously*.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 105`
 * - `1 <= batteries[i] <= 109`
 *
 * @param {number} n - The number of computers.
 * @param {number[]} batteries - Array of battery times for each computer.
 * @return {number} - The maximum number of minutes all n computers can run simultaneously.
