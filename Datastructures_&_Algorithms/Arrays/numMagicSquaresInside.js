/**
 * **840. Magic Squares In Grid**
 *
 * A `3 x 3` **magic square** is a `3 x 3` grid filled with distinct numbers
 * from 1 **to** 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have
 * the same sum.
 *
 * Given a `row x col` `grid` of integers, how many `3 x 3` contiguous magic
 * square subgrids are there?
 *
 * **Note**: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9,
 * `grid` may contain numbers up to 15.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
