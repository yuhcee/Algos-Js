/**
 * **2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions**
 *
 * You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m`
 * respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the `ith` spell and `potions[j]`
 * represents the strength of the `jth` potion.
 *
 * You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered **successful** if
 * the **product** of their strengths is **at least** `success`.
 *
 * Return *an integer array `pairs` of length `n` where `pairs[i]` is the number of **potions** that
 * will form a successful pair with the `ith` spell*.
 *
 * **Constraints:
 * 
 * - `n == spells.length`
 * - `m == potions.length`
 * - `1 <= n, m <= 105`
 * - `1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105`
 * - `1 <= success <= 1010`
 * 
 * @param {number[]} spells
 * @param {number[]} potions
 * @param {number} success
 * @return {number[]}
