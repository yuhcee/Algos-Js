/**
 * **2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips**
 *
 * You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `ith` bus to complete
 * one trip.
 *
 * Each bus can make multiple trips **successively**; that is, the next trip can start **immediately
 * after** completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates **independently**; that is, the trips
 * of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.
 *
 * You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should
 * make **in total**. Return *the **minimum time** required for all buses to complete **at least**
 * `totalTrips` trips*.
 *
 * @param {number[]} time
 * @param {number} totalTrips
 * @return {number}
