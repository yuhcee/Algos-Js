/**
 * **137. Single Number II**
 *
 * Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one,
 * which appears **exactly once**. *Find the single element and return it*.
 *
 * You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra
 * space.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
 * - `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
 * - Each element in `nums` appears exactly **three times** except for one element which
 * appears **once**.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
