/**
 * **1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix**
 *
 * Given an `m x n` matrix of **distinct** numbers, return *all **lucky
 * numbers** in the matrix in **any** order*.
 *
 * A **lucky number** is an element of the matrix such that it is the
 * minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 * - `m == mat.length`
 * - `n == mat[i].length`
 * - `1 <= n, m <= 50`
 * - `1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105.`
 * - All elements in the matrix are distinct.
 * 
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {number[]}
