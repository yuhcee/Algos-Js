/**
 * **2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign**
 * 
 * You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length 
 * consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.
 * 
 * You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified 
 * array follows the given conditions:
 * 
 * 1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
 * 2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were 
 * present in `nums` is **preserved**.
 * 3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.
 * 
 * Return *the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the 
 * aforementioned conditions*.
 * 
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 * - `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105`
 * - `nums.length` is **even**
 * - `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105`
 * - `nums` consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
