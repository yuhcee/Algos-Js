/**
 * **1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets**
 *
 * You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.
 *
 * You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k`
 * **adjacent flowers** from the garden.
 *
 * The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the
 * `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in **exactly one** bouquet.
 *
 * Return *the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m`
 * bouquets from the garden*. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return `-1`.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `bloomDay.length == n`
 * - `1 <= n <= 105`
 * - `1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 109`
 * - `1 <= m <= 106`
 * - `1 <= k <= n`
 *
 * @param {number[]} bloomDay
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
