/**
 * **260. Single Number III**
 *
 * Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once
 * and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that
 * appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses
 * only constant extra space
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
 * - `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
 * - Each integer in `nums` will appear twice, only two integers will appear
 * once.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
