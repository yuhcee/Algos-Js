/**
 * **2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid**
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can add `x` to or subtract
 * `x` from any element in the `grid`.
 *
 * A **uni-value grid** is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.
 *
 * Return the **minimum** number of operations to make the grid **uni-value**. If it is not possible, return `-1`.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {number}
