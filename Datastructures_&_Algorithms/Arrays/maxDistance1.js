 * **624. Maximum Distance in Arrays**

 * You are given `m` arrays, where each array is sorted in **ascending

 *
 * You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks
 * one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two
 * integers `a` and `b` to be their absolute difference `|a - b|`.
 *
 * Return *the maximum distance*.

 * @param {number[][]} arrays
