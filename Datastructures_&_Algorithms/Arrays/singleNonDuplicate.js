/**
 * **540. Single Element in a Sorted Array**
 *
 * You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly
 * twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.
 *
 * Return *the single element that appears only once.*
 *
 * Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 * 
 * - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
 * - `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
