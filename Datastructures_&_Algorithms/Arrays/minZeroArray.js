/**
 * **3356. Zero Array Transformation II**
 *
 * You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [li, ri, vali]`.
 *
 * Each `queries[i]` represents the following action on `nums`:
 *
 * - Decrement the value at each index in the range `[li, ri]` in `nums` by at **mos** vali.
 * - The amount by which each value is decremented can be chosen **independently** for each index.
 *
 * A **Zero Array** is an array with all its elements equal to 0.
 *
 * Return the **minimum** possible **non-negative** value of `k`, such that after processing the first `k` queries
 * in **sequence**, nums becomes a **Zero Array**. If no such `k` exists, return -1.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {number}
