/**
 * **826. Most Profit Assigning Work**
 *
 * You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`,
 * `profit`, and `worker` where:
 *
 * - `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the
 * `ith` job, and
 * - `worker[j]` is the ability of `jth` worker (i.e., the `jth` worker can only
 * complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).
 *
 * Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be
 * **completed multiple times**.
 *
 * - For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the
 * total profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit
 * is `$0`.
 *
 * Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the
 * jobs.
 *
 * @param {number[]} difficulty
 * @param {number[]} profit
 * @param {number[]} worker
 * @return {number}
