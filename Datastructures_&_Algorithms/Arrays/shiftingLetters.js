/**
 * **2381. Shifting Letters II**
 *
 * You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer
 * array `shifts` where `shifts[i] = [starti, endi, directioni]`. For every
 * `i`, **shift** the characters in `s` from the index `starti` to the index
 * `endi` (**inclusive**) forward if `directioni = 1`, or shift the characters
 * backward if `directioni = 0`.
 *
 * Shifting a character **forward** means replacing it with the **next** letter
 * in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). Similarly,
 * shifting a character **backward** means replacing it with the **previous**
 * letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'a'` becomes `'z'`).
 *
 * Return *the final string after all such shifts to s are applied*.
 *
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number[][]} shifts
 * @return {string}
