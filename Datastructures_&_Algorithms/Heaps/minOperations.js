/**
 * **3066. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II**
 *
 * You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, and an integer `k`.
 *
 * You are allowed to perform some operations on `nums`, where in a single
 * operation, you can:
 *
 * - Select the two smallest integers `x` and `y` from `nums`.
 * - Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.
 * - Insert `(min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y))` at any position in the array.
 * **Note** that you can only apply the described operation if `nums`
 * contains at least two elements.
 *
 * Return the **minimum** number of operations needed so that all elements
 * of the array are greater than or equal to `k`.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
