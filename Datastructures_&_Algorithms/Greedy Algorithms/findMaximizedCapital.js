/**
 * **502. IPO**
 * 
 * Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to
 * Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the
 * **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before
 * the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at
 * most `k` distinct projects.
 *
 * You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum
 * capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.
 *
 * Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and
 * the profit will be added to your total capital.
 *
 * Pick a list of at most `k` distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital,
 * and return *the final maximized capital*.
 *
 * The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 * This function finds the maximum amount of capital that can be raised by performing at most k
 * projects.
 *
 * The function takes in the following parameters:
 *
 * @param {number} k - The maximum number of projects that can be performed.
 * @param {number} initialCapital - The initial capital available to invest.
 * @param {number[]} profits - An array of profits to be earned from each project.
 * @param {number[]} capital - An array of capital required for each project.
 * @returns {number} - The maximum amount of capital that can be raised.
