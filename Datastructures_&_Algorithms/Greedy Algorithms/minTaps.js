/**
 * **1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden**
 *
 * There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts
 * at the point `0` and ends at the point `n`. (i.e The length of the
 * garden is `n`).
 *
 * There are `n + 1` taps located at points `[0, 1, ..., n]` in the
 * garden.
 *
 * Given an integer `n` and an integer array `ranges` of length `n +
 * 1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the
 * area `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it was open.
 *
 * Return *the minimum number of taps* that should be open to water
 * the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.
 *
 * **Constraints:**
 *
 * - `1 <= n <= 104`
 * - `ranges.length == n + 1`
 * - `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`
 *
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[]} ranges
 * @return {number}
